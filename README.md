# ytDownloader

This is a Terminal Utility written in python.

This Script can help you with downloading entire YouTube Playlist in one go.


## Steps: [Same for Windows/Linux]
- Install Python (if you dont have it)
- Download this script to your device. ( Either git clone, or zip)
- Now, just run the following command in the terminal:
  > python3 ytdownloader.py
  
- Enjoy!!


### Note : The files will be downloaded in the current(working) directory



## Things to be done:
- Make minor changes to let user download just single videos too
- Introduce start and stop pointers, so we can download playlist in parts.
- Exception Handling
- Do something so the videos maintain order, once downloaded. Maybe add numbers to their name before downloading
- ....
